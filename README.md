# This is a VHDL description of a positive-edge triggered 16-bit input to 9-bit output Memory Address Register (MAR) and a Memory Data Register with  two 16-bit inputs and a 16-bit output. Both the MAR and MDR have synchronous control signals: reset and enable. When reset = 0, output = 0 for both MDR and MAR. For the MAR, when enable = 1, output is the 9 LSB of input and when enable = 0, output is isolated(high impedance denoted by 'ZZZZZZZZZ'). For the MDR, when enable = 1, output is the first 16 bit input and when enable = 0, output latches to the second 16-bit input. 
# Test vectors are generated using MATLAB and the input/expected output files are tested in the testbench 
# entity description and architecture are both in the .vhd files 
# Pictures of the data flow schematics have been added for both MAR and MDR.
